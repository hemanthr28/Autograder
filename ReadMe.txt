This is a script for autograding c/cpp assignment. 

Every student submissions must be in separate folder for this script to work. E.g Student1, Student2 ... 

Grading_Scrip_Inputst.sh takes a c/cpp file compiles and runs it and the output will be pushed into a csv file.
Use this script only if your program accepts an input from the comamnd line. Add the required input in the Inputs.txt file. 


Use Grading_Script_NoInputs.sh if your program doesn't need any input. 

Once the script is run completely, an output.csv file will be created, which will have the folder name in which the file was and the output of the program.
